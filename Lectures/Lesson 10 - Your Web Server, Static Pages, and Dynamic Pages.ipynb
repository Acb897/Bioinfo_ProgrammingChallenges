    "It is surprisingly easy to create dynamic Web pages!  All you must do is write a Ruby script that outputs HTML!  (it really is that easy!!)\n",

    "\n",
    "The [HTTP Protocol Specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230) requires that a Web server **MUST** provide information about what “kind of stuff” it is going to send to the Browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you are browsing static pages, your Web server generally decides this automatically (usually by looking at the file extension (e.g. index.<span style=\"color: red;\">html</span>,   mypage.<span style=\"color: red;\">txt</span>,  document.<span style=\"color: red;\">pdf</span>)\n",
    "\n",
    "When you are creating dynamic content from a script, you must tell the Server what kind of data you are going to send - it has no way to know!  Maybe your script produces HTML... maybe it produces XML... maybe it produces Linked Data... maybe it produces a PDF, or an Image...??  You must tell the server what the content of the HTTP message will be\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the most simplistic case, it is this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Content-Type: text/html\n",
    "    \n",
    "    body starts here......\n",
    "    \n",
    "So, a field named \"Content-Type:\"  with a value that must be [one of the types on this list](https://www.sitepoint.com/mime-types-complete-list/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Followed by a blank line\n",
    "\n",
    "...and that's all!\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this in Ruby, you simply say:\n",
    "\n",
    "    print \"Content-Type: text/html  \\n\\n\";\n",
