    "\n",
    "## Objective 1:  Encapsulation\n",
    "\n",
    "“Encapsulation” means that you group together all of the properties and methods that are appropriate for that “thing”.  The objective is to make your software more intuitive or common-sense.  Also, to avoid name-conflicts.  For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Papers can be submitted or edited\n",
    "* Grant Proposals can be submitted or edited\n",
    "\n",
    "If I see the command “submit” in my software, what does it mean?  How can I know?  \n",
    "\n",
    "I can associate it with a Class, to distinguish between \"submit\" for the Paper class, and \"submit\" for the Grant Proposal class.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective 2:  Abstraction\n",
    "\n",
    "As much as possible, you want your software to represent WHAT is being done, rather than HOW it is done.  This makes  your software becomes *much* easier to understand (both by others, and by **you**!)\n",
    "\n",
    "**WHAT**:  Paper -> submit\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**HOW**: Gather the authorship list, the title, and the text of the paper.  Connect to the journal website.  Submit the information.  Wait for reply.  Extract the submission id and editors note from the reply.  Give this information to the submitter.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly, it is easier to say \"paper->submit\" than to read that list of sub-activities and understand what they are doing.  You have \"abstracted\" the complexity of submitting a paper by giving a name to that collection of sub-activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective 3:  Reuse and Inheritence\n",
    "\n",
    "As you saw above, we created four different presidents using a single President class.  Ths is \"reuse\" - all individuals of a given class can hold the same information, and execute the same actions, without any additional code.\n",
    "\n",
    "A different kind of reuse is called \"Inheritence\".  Notice that our President class has properties that are true of all humans - for example, Hair color, and age.  In this case, it would be better to create multiple classes, that use \"Inheritence\":\n",
    "\n",
    " **Class** “Human” \n",
    "\n",
    "    property: age\n",
    "    property: hair color\n",
    "\n",
    " **Class** \"President” \n",
    "\n",
    "    Inherit:  Class \"Human\"\n",
    "    Property:  “years in office”\n",
    "\n",
    "Instances of the President Class would then have “age”, “hair color” and “time_in_office” properties\n",
